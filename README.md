# DeepLC
 
In order to use DeepLC to predict the retention time of non-canonical peptides, we first predicted the effect of the model for canonical peptides of the same project.

All canonical peptides are divided into ten parts, nine for model calibration and one for prediction. I used two calibration model methods. Here are the results of the predicted canonical peptide.
